# Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis and visualization using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The code analyzes the famous Iris dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, cleaning, statistical analysis, and creating various visualizations to uncover insights about the data.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Exploration**: Loads the Iris dataset and examines its structure
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values through imputation
- **Statistical Analysis**: Computes descriptive statistics and group-wise aggregations
- **Data Visualization**: Creates multiple plot types including:
  - Line charts
  - Bar charts
  - Histograms
  - Scatter plots
  - Box plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Pairplots

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## Installation

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage

1. Save the code as either:
   - A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file)
   - A Python script (.py file)

2. Run the code:
   ```bash
   # If saved as a Python script
   python iris_analysis.py
   
   # If using Jupyter Notebook
   jupyter notebook iris_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Code Structure

The code is organized into three main tasks:

1. **Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset**
   - Loads the Iris dataset
   - Displays dataset information and structure
   - Handles missing values through imputation

2. **Task 2: Basic Data Analysis**
   - Computes descriptive statistics
   - Performs group-wise analysis by species
   - Identifies key patterns in the data

3. **Task 3: Data Visualization**
   - Creates multiple visualization types
   - Customizes plots with titles, labels, and legends
   - Generates additional insightful visualizations

## Dataset

The code uses the Iris dataset from scikit-learn, which contains measurements of:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)
- Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

## Key Findings

- Setosa species has significantly smaller petal measurements
- Versicolor and Virginica have overlapping but distinct measurements
- Sepal width shows the smallest variation across species
- Strong correlation exists between petal length and petal width

## Customization

To use your own dataset:
1. Replace the data loading section with code to load your CSV file:
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
   ```
2. Adjust column names and analysis as needed for your specific dataset

## Output

The code generates:
- Console output with statistical summaries
- Multiple visualization plots in separate windows
- Insights about the dataset patterns

## Submission

Submit the completed file (Jupyter Notebook or Python script) through your course's designated platform. Ensure all code runs without errors before submission.
